      <p>
        Adopting a cat instead of buying one had multiple advantages. U are
        giving them a second chance at life once u adopt them. It also reduces
        the number of stray cats, because at the moment there are between
        approximately 135.590 and 1.200.000. Most cats at shelters are already
        vaccinated, had their paws spayed, had their health examined and most of
        them were also neutered. A lot of them already have such big
        personalities and that makes every one of them unique. By adopting a cat
        u support several important causes such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overpopulation</li>
        <li>Unenthical breeder</li>
        <li>Responsible pet ownership</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong> Overpopulation: </strong>
        <br>
        By making sure that adopted cats are spayed or neutered we can prevent
        unwanted litters. As said before in the intro there are a lot of stray
        cays. it could be that this was a result of cats not being neutered and
        causing litters.
        <br>
        <strong>Unenthical breeder:</strong>
        <br>
        Unfortunately there are still a lot of ‚Äúbackyard breeders‚Äù who are till
        this day breeding cats who have a high risk of having bad health etc.
        These cats(animals in general) are frequently abused or neglected and
        exploited.
        <br>
        <strong>Responsible pet ownership: </strong>
        <br>
        Adoption helps and promote other potential owners to have the right
        amount of responsibility of pet care and also help one in need. It also
        make space for other cats who are in need of help and a space to stay
        at.

      <h4>Orfeas & yiska & kasumi</h4>
      <h5>
        These 3 cats really stood out for me. Mostly because their personalities
        were so big yet so cute. T
      </h5>
      <p>
        Orfeas was the last one that i really noticed just because he was very
        calm and just minding his own bussines. Later on he was very curious and
        tried to come closer. Once he did that i noticed that he missed one of
        his legs but that didnt hold him back for trying to navigate around the
        place etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        middle one was called "Yiska" and she was very curious but still very
        cautious. later on I heard that she was kind of sassy because she liked
        the attetion but once you tried to pet her, she would really slap your
        hands with her paw
      </p>
      <p>
        The last one was called "kasumi" and she was the "princess" of the
        place. She was very sleepy when I got there and she only looked up one
        or twice just to see who was petting her.
